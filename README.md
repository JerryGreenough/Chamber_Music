# Chamber_Music
Creation and querying of a database of chamber music using MySQL and SQLAlchemy.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple demonstration of how the ORM functionality provided by Flask SQLAlchemy can be used to create and query a relational database. Once constructed, the database contains references to works of "chamber music", a genre of classical music that requires a samll number of performers - typcially 2-10 musicians. A chamber music work involves a variety of instruments, the most popular form of which is the "String Quartet" which requires 4 performers that invariably consist of: a viola player, a cello player and two violin players. Other forms of chamber music exist, the most popular of which are listed in one of the database tables ("Work_Types").

The enitre repertoire of chamber music contains thousands of works, only a few of which are currently represented by the SQL scripts presented in this project. However, it is hoped that at a later date a more complete representation of the repertoire will be made available. Every effort has been made to ensure accuracy of the database content.
