# Chamber_Music
Creation and querying of a database of chamber music using MySQL and SQLAlchemy.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple demonstration of how the ORM functionality provided by Flask SQLAlchemy can be used to create and query a relational database. The database itself contains references to works of "chamber music", a genre of classical music that requires a samll number of performers - typcially 2-10 musicians. A chamber music work involves a variety of instruments, the most popular form of which is the "String Quartet" which requires 4 performers that invariably consist of: a viola player, a cello player and two violin players. Other forms of chamber music exist, and these may be persued in a table called "Work_Types".
